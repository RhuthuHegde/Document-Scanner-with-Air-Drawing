# Document-Scanner-with-Air-Drawing
This project intends to make a drawing or annotating hands-free by using Hand tracking modules and virtually drawing on a Scanned document and is a major application of Computer Vision. The document is captured in real-time and stored in the system, which is then cropped to remove the unwanted edges and background and saved again. It uses edge detection and Canny detection and does automatic corner detection, image sharpening, and colour thresholding. The hand tracking is module is used to detect the fingertips from the web camera for drawing on the Canvas using the Index finger. Two fingers are used for colour selection and an Index finger is used to annotate on the document making it contact-less and easy.
